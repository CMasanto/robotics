README FILE

March 2016:
This folder contains the preliminary matlab programs
for solving the path planning algorithm question in Homework 2.
Please study them and use them as the basis for your solution.
You are free to modify them in anyway you like.

As discussed in lecture today, there are some missing elements
required for the homework:
	(1) Union-Find Data structure
	(2) Maintaining adjacency of boxes
		(only needed for FREE/MIXED boxes)
	(3) Search Strategies
	(4) Final Path planning


NOTES:
In hw2, we ask you to represent boxes as a pair of points.
	Please ignore that suggestion, and treat boxes just as you
	would treat any polygon.  Recall that we said that
	a polygon with n vertices should be represented 
	as two vectors X, Y of the length n.  This is the format
	that the "patch" method requires.
